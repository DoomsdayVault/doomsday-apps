### Ratings
I've found that ratings are needed to evaluate the doomday preparedness of a specific application.

|Rating|Meaning|
|----|---|
|No stars| The app is not rated yet|
|![1star](https://github.com/DoomsdayVault/doomsday-apps/blob/master/images/1star.png)|This means that the app is in a state that needs refurbishing or has UI/UX glitches|
|![2star](https://github.com/DoomsdayVault/doomsday-apps/blob/master/images/2star.png)|Reliable but needs more stability to be Doomsday approved|
|![3star](https://github.com/DoomsdayVault/doomsday-apps/blob/master/images/3star.png)|Doomsday approved app|

* The  ![offgrid](https://github.com/DoomsdayVault/doomsday-apps/blob/master/images/offgrid-batch.png) batch means that we've tested that the application works on any network without internet.
* The  ![beta](https://github.com/DoomsdayVault/doomsday-apps/blob/master/images/beta-batch.png) batch means that the project may not be relyable for the doomsday moment (Be careful).
